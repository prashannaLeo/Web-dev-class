        <h1>Working with stakeholders of the web</h1>
        <p>
            A range of organizations join the World Wide Web Consortium as
            Members to work with us to drive the direction of core web
            technologies and exchange ideas with industry and research leaders.
            We rotate randomly a few of our Member organizations' logos
            underneath.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Web Consortium and its members, with help from the public and
            the web community, focus on a range of business ecosystems that the
            web transforms, including
