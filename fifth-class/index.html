                <h2>Nepal register first win over Test nation</h2>
                <p>Kathmandu, Jan. 24 -- Nepal's national women's cricket team
                    recorded their first-ever victory over a Test-playing
                    nation, defeating Zimbabwe by six wickets in the ICC Women's
                    T20 World Cup Global Qualifier on Saturday.

                    After losing the toss and being sent in to bat, Zimbabwe
                    posted 129 for six in their allotted 20 overs at the
                    Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground in
                    Kirtipur. Nepal chased down the target with three balls to
                    spare, reaching 133 for four, thanks largely to an unbeaten
                    half-century from vice-captain Pooja Mahato.

                    Pooja scored 52 not out off 50 balls, hitting four fours and
                    two sixes, anchoring the chase after early wickets. Nepal
                    benefited significantly from Zimbabwe's erratic bowling,
                    collecting 20 runs in extras, including 17 wides.

                    scored 15 off 17 balls. Captain Indu Barma and Pooja then
                    added a crucial 35-run partnership for the third wicket.
                    Indu scored 22 off 23 balls with two fours and a six before
                    being bowled by Josephine Nkomo.</p>
